First We will have the different Folder for the new project.
Inside it we will write git init to initialise the local repo,
Basically it will be hidden we can use ls -a to view all type of files

touch tuto.txt
//Wrote content inside the tuto
git init
// Some commands related to the git
git init  - to initialise empty local repo
git status - To get the details about the files, like which all are commited, needs to be tracked and nore
git log     - TO list out all the previous commits
git add     - To start tracking or to use the version control, we shld stage them, that is add the files saying these
what i am interested in tracking
git commit -m "message" - To commit changes
git checkout <file> Say if you messed up, you can use this you get back to the prevoius commited part of the file





****************************To revert Back from staged*****************
git rm --cached -r











********Now Everything Done***********



If you want to collaborate with others, or if the system crashes everything gets crashed right?
So we go for gitHub, where you can store everything online

To start You did basic all above steps, Now go to gitHub
Create new Repo,
DO everyting required there,
later copy the ssh code, and in ur project Folder
add that online repo by 

git remote add <name> <url>  //By convention we use name as origin
//Go the branch
git branch -M <branch>
//Push online
git push -u <name> <branch>  //-u is called linking

next in tuto2.txt





*****************************Git Ignore***********************************************



say For some files you dont want to upload or commit them
Like may be passwords folder, or the packages folder npm i type
because they keep on updating, so whenever the other collaborater works on his pc 
he always does npm i, so no need to upload those type of files

So to do them 

We create the secrete file called gitignore //casing matters
to create the secreate file shld start with .<name> 
.gitignore
to view ls -a 

inside the gitIgnore, in each line, add the file names u want to Ignore
like
pass.txt
apis.txt etc

Do normal as before
like git add . //here it wont add the files mentioned in the gitignore
// And thats it done
