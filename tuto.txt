First We will have the different Folder for the new project.
Inside it we will write git init to initialise the local repo,
Basically it will be hidden we can use ls -a to view all type of files

touch tuto.txt
//Wrote content inside the tuto
git init
// Some commands related to the git
git init  - to initialise empty local repo
git status - To get the details about the files, like which all are commited, needs to be tracked and nore
git log     - TO list out all the previous commits
git add     - To start tracking or to use the version control, we shld stage them, that is add the files saying these
what i am interested in tracking
git commit -m "message" - To commit changes
git checkout <file> Say if you messed up, you can use this you get back to the prevoius commited part of the file

********Now Everything Done***********
If you want to collaborate with others, or if the system crashes everything gets crashed right?
So we go for gitHub, where you can store everything online

To start You did basic all above steps, Now go to gitHub
Create new Repo,
DO everyting required there,
later copy the ssh code, and in ur project Folder
add that online repo by 

git remote add <name> <url>  //By convention we use name as origin
//Go the branch
git branch -M <branch>
//Push online
git push -u <name> <branch>  //-u is called linking
